Welcome to my repository that showcases the culmination of my one-month internship at OASIS Infobyte. In this repository, you will find three impressive projects that I worked on during my time with OASIS Infobyte: a calculator, a to-do app, and a tribute page.

Calculator:
The calculator project is a comprehensive and user-friendly application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. It provides a sleek and intuitive interface with all the essential features such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. This calculator has been meticulously designed and developed to ensure accuracy and efficiency, making it an invaluable tool for everyday calculations.

To-Do App:
The to-do app is a powerful productivity tool that helps users manage their tasks and stay organized. With a clean and minimalist design, this application allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, set deadlines, and prioritize their to-do list. It also offers features such as reminders and notifications, ensuring that users never miss an important task. This to-do app is built with efficiency and simplicity in mind, providing a seamless experience for users to boost their productivity.

Tribute Page:
The tribute page is a special project that pays homage to a notable individual, organization, or cause. It serves as a platform to honor and highlight their achievements, contributions, and impact. The tribute page I created during my internship is a visually appealing and informative webpage that showcases the remarkable accomplishments of the chosen subject. Through a combination of engaging content, captivating visuals, and an interactive layout, this tribute page captures the essence of the subject and educates visitors about their significance.

Each of these projects demonstrates my proficiency in front-end development, user interface design, and problem-solving skills. Throughout my internship at OASIS Infobyte, I had the opportunity to learn and apply industry best practices, collaborate with a talented team, and enhance my technical abilities.

Feel free to explore this repository to delve into the intricacies of each project. Whether you're interested in the functionality of the calculator, the productivity benefits of the to-do app, or the captivating tribute page, I hope these projects showcase my dedication and passion for software development.
